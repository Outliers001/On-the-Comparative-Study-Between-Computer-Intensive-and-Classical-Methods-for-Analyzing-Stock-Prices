The stock market plays a pivotal role in the growth of the economy of a country. Stock
market analysis enables investors to identify the intrinsic worth of a security even before
investing in it. Factors like supply and demand in the market, market sentiment and
investor’s expectations, economic and political shocks can affect stock prices. All these
factors make stock prices volatile and noisy. Machine learning techniques have the
capacity to insights the unseen and derive hidden patterns from features of data like the
latest reports about a company, their opening and closing price, day’s high and day’s
low etc.
Several methods including statistics and artificial intelligence are being developed
in order to turn prediction more accurate and reliable. In this research, we conduct a
comparative study between computer intensive and classical methods on the problem of
stock market forecasting in case of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Two machine learning models,
Linear Support Vector Regression(SVR) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Regression
be treated as computer intensive method and a statistical method, Auto-regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) be treated as classical method . The purpose of
this research is to examine the feasibility and performance of SVR, KNN and ARIMA
model in forecasting closing price of selected company from Dhaka Stock Exchange
(DSE). We optimize the models by testing different hyper-parameters, i.e., the values
of " and C in case of Linear SVR, the values of k in case of KNN and the values of p, d
q in case of ARIMA. For each model, Root Mean Square Errors(RMSE) are calculated
by analyzing historical data of three stocks that are based on Dhaka Stock Exchange
(DSE). Our study shows that, Linear SVR is more effective and efficient technique to
predict the prices of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE).
